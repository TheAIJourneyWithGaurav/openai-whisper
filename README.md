# Transcription Tutorial with OpenAI Whisper and Faster-Whisper

Welcome to the Transcription Tutorial using the OpenAI Whisper model and the faster-whisper implementation! In this repository, you'll find resources and code examples to guide you through utilizing these advanced transcription technologies.

## Overview

Transcription plays a vital role in transforming spoken words into text, enabling us to capture important details in various scenarios, such as YouTube videos, virtual meetings, and interactions with voice assistants.

In this tutorial, you will:

- Learn how to use the OpenAI Whisper model, a transformer-based model with an encoder-decoder architecture and a self-attention mechanism for efficient audio transcription.
- Explore how to use faster-whisper for faster inference times compared to the original OpenAI Whisper model.
- Transcribe audio files using the provided code examples and observe the results.

The tutorial includes a simple function to transcribe audio files using both OpenAI Whisper and faster-whisper. By the end, you'll have a good understanding of how to leverage these powerful transcription tools.

Happy transcribing!
